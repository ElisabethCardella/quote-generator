# quote-generator
The goal is be both simple and fun: build a quote generator! Quotes will be constructed randomly by putting sentence pieces together.

Step 1: random quotes
The quotes are randomly generated one by one each time the JavaScript program is called.
Each quote is the combination of at least 3 sentence pieces (it's up to you to prepare these sentence pieces)
If not intelligible, the sentence must be consistent (no exclamation mark in the middle of a sentence)
The program can simply display the result in the JavaScript console.

Step 2: configurable quotes
Choose the number of quotes generated (from 1 to 5)
Choose between 2 types of quote generators (so you will need to have 2 sets of sentences)
the quotes have been generated, offer to generate new quotes or stop the program there
The program is adapted so that it can provide these features.
